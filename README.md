# Kaggle-NLP-Competition

This Kaggle NLP competition was held in 2019, our team ranked 77th in the end. The code was written in TF v1.13 and the TPU implementation was different from current version. To reproduce the previous work, I rewrite the code of BERT part with TF2.4 and the Huggingface package.
